BlankActivity36 is modified to reflect (from memory) the old 3.5 blank activity to create it I deleted the following

navigation folder and all its content

from the res/layout folder
content_main.xml
fragment_first.xml
fragment_second.xml

from the first folder in java
FirstFragment.java
SecondFragment.java

BlankActivity36NavGraph

Here I used the 3.6 blank activity which includes the navgraph and some starting fragments.  I added the safeargs and passed a string.  Very easy.
